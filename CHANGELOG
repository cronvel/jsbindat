v0.11.7
-------

Referencing any strings (opt-in, improve space-efficiency)


v0.11.6
-------

Referencing object's keys (opt-in, improve space-efficiency)


v0.11.5
-------

Data Model can now be used with instance serialization


v0.11.4
-------

New: support for Data Model, for space-efficient serialization (very good for network transmissions)


v0.11.3
-------

Removing a console.log() (woopsy)


v0.11.2
-------

Stream-kit dependencies, and .serialize() now support an initial buffer to be prepended to the serialization

-------

Dependencies


v0.11.0

BREAKING: now the binary (un)serializer read from/write to buffer instead of stream, which is more flexible


v0.10.3
-------

Fix previous commit (also the previous commit message was wrong)


v0.10.2
-------

StreamBuffer: compute bytelength in writeUtf8() (it was an internal function that is now promoted as API)


v0.10.1
-------

Support for function (opt-in, because it can be a security hole when unserializing from an untrusted source)


v0.10.0
