v0.10.2
-------

StreamBuffer: compute bytelength in writeUtf8() (it was an internal function that is now promoted as API)


v0.10.1
-------

Support for function (opt-in, because it can be a security hole when unserializing from an untrusted source)


v0.10.0
-------

BREAKING CHANGE: fixing bad spelling: 'overide' -> 'override'
